orabot is an entertainment irc bot mainly for #openra channel on freenode. It also provides current game list of openra games; makes channel's logs; translate texts; sends an offline messages; etc.

More info: https://github.com/ihptru/orabot/wiki

To start the bot:
./run.py

To start with notifications support:
./run.py --notify
But there must be made some changes in orabot.py:
1) Change variable values: root_admin and root_admin_password
2) At the bottom of orabot.py change server/port/channel where to connect and bot's name
3) Due to security reasons, you should change value of `root_admin_password` value to something different
